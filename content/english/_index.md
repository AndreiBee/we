<div class="left-questions">

{{< accordion "How much does it cost?" >}}

Prices vary, of course, depending on the scope of the project. I structure my work into three categories of websites:

- **Simple**
- **Advanced**
- **Large sites/e-shops**

Depending on the project specifications, I will create a quote based on an estimate of labor hours. If you are interested in additional services such as site editing, SEO, PPC, etc., my hourly rate is 1000 CZK.

{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "What is included in the offer?" >}}

Again, this depends on the nature of the project and its scope. I prepare all the details of the services and workflow during a joint consultation. However, basic web development usually includes the following:

- Creating a structured introduction page for the show (based on a template)
- Design and implementation of subpages
- Insertion of content and photos
- Implementation of a contact form
- SEO setup, including robots.txt analysis, sitemap.xml, duplicate removal, heading and description optimization
- Ensuring responsiveness on different devices - desktop, tablet, mobile and more

{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Is there an advance invoice option?" >}}

Yes, half of the deposit must be paid in advance once the quote is approved. The remaining amount will be settled only after the website is completely designed according to your requirements.

{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Do I need web hosting and a domain?" >}}

No, I'll take care of everything.

{{< /accordion >}}

</div>

<div class="right-questions">

{{< accordion "What will I need before starting?" >}}

We can talk on the phone and go over everything, or if you prefer a quicker process, please attach:

- Content (or I can create a sample text that we can edit later)
- Specific customization requests or links to other pages
- Any images or videos you have available
- Logo (along with colors for your site)

{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "I don't have any content yet. What should I do?" >}}

I design your website with a high-resolution preview and sample text. Once the website is created, we can easily edit the content after it is completely finished.

{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Can you design a logo for my website?" >}}

Yes, I will create an attractive company logo according to your services.

{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Will I be able to edit my website easily? I am not a programmer...." >}}

Yes, but I wouldn't recommend doing it without a professional help.
